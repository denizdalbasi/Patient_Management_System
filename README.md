#Hospital Record System

    Hospital Record System is a Python-based desktop application developed using Tkinter for managing patient records in a hospital environment. The application provides a graphical user interface that allows users to add, update, delete, and browse patient information efficiently. It also includes automatic Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation and database-backed persistent storage.

Features
    
    Manage patient personal and medical information
    
    Add new patient records
    
    Update existing patient records
    
    Delete individual patient records or clear all records
    
    Navigate between patient entries
    
    Automatic BMI calculation based on height and weight
    
    Selection of blood type and hospital department
    
    Database integration for persistent data storage
    
    Faker integration for generating realistic test data
    
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design

Technologies Used

    Python 3
    
    Tkinter for graphical user interface development
    
    SQLite database (via a custom Database class)
    
    Faker library for test data generation

Purpose

    This project was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate Python GUI development, object-oriented programming principles, and basic database operations. It is suitable for academic use and personal learning projects.
